# Crossfeed
Externalisation of headphone audio, implemented as VST3 using the JUCE framework. The algorithm estimates the Inter-aural Time Difference for sounds placed externally to introduce a crossfeed between the left and right channels of stereo audio meant for headphone listening. The crossfeed is also processed to (1) approximate the effect of the acoustic shadow of the head, (2) eliminate comb filtering, and (3) ensure that the audio is spectrally uncoloured.
